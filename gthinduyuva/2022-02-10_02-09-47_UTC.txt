Thank you to everyone that came out to our Surya Namaskar Yogathon!! Collectively we performed over 2,500 Surya Namaskars in less than 2 hours!!

GT Hindu YUVA organized this Yogathon to celebrate Makar Sankranti, when the Sun begins its Uttarayan movement, from the south to the north. To recognize this movement, the significance of the Sun in our lives, and to raise awareness for the importance of yoga, we gathered on the Georgia Tech campus to do Surya Namaskar!
