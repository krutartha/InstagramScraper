The Swāgatam Airport Pickup was a huge success! GT Hindu YUVA and GT Vivekananda House gave free airport rides to 150 incoming GT students. These students were picked up from the airport, brought to @gtvivekanandahouse for snacks and dinner, and were then dropped off at their residential halls. 20 driver volunteers and 5 current GT students offered their time and cars, MH 15 provided free dinner for the three nights, and the American-Indian community in Greater Atlanta gave logistical support. 👏
