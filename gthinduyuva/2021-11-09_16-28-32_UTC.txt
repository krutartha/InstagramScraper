Namaste everyone! Hope you had a wonderful and joyful Diwali! GT Hindu YUVA had a blast this Diwali with multiple activities and meetings. We thank everyone who came out to be a part of the @gtiambassadors Night Market and engaged with us. We also want to thank Dr. Hong and members of @engagegt for the opportunity to meet and celebrate Diwali with them. 
We also thank @indiaclub_gt and BAPS for organizing amazing Diwali events on campus to showcase Hindu values and culture!
