Challenge yourself and friends this Saturday be a part of the Surya Namaskar Marathon! Young students from all of the Southeast US will come together online and collectively achieve the task of continuously performing Surya Namaskars (a sequence of 10 asanas saluting the sun!) back to back for 12 hours! 

At any point of time, you can enter the event using the Zoom link below and follow the demonstrative video being played to do the Surya Namaskar Asanas. The goal is to really stretch your limits and do it as many times as you can with everyone else by your side. You are free to take breaks/refreshments or leave any time as required. The event will keep going continuously from noon to midnight!

Please make sure to register using the link IN OUR BIO (takes only 2 minutes): https://forms.gle/yECgbJAR93racQEKA
