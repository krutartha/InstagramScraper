Namaste, 

As you would know, the month of August marks a new beginning for those who are joining college. Hindu YUVA at Georgia Tech is organizing a meet-up for the incoming students in colleges in/near Atlanta (GAtech, Emory, GSU, UGA). The idea is for the freshmen and existing students to get to know each other and help out with necessary advice and logistics as the transitioning to college sets off. 

Please join us on the first weekend of August by registering using the following form. Kindly feel free invite any of your contacts as well who are joining any of these colleges in the coming Fall. The exact timing will be decided based on your input to the form.
