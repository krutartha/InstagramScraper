As we welcome the new academic year, allow us to take you through the memory lane.

Here is our year in review for the academic year 2019-2020. The video premiered at the Namaste YUVA event and we are very happy to share our progress with all of you! Hope to make more wonderful memories this year while we strengthen our club and provide a platform to practice Hindu values and perform Hindu activities on Georgia Tech campus!
