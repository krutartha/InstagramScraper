Happy faces from the last week's YUVA Varg! It was an extended Milan that lasted from Nov 7th Saturday 6:30pm to Nov 8th Sunday noon! 

- The event began with ice-breakers prepared by @r_bhome and @sonaljape929. 
- Next, attendees got to know about the journey of @hinduyuvausa from @jjkathiriya Ji.
- Then, @itbeharshalit and co. organized a Karyashala which made us think about various Hindu Values ingrained in us and how it affects our daily interactions with our family, friends, neighborhood, local communities and the larger society.
- @kanchainz and co. organized the Ratri Karyakram where the participants had fun answering @sonaljape929's rapid ðŸ”¥ questions and laughing at @ashwinlele's funny videos.
- Finally, Dr. Tarun Ji Mangla gave the closing remarks on Sunday where he shared his journey in Sangh, @hssusageorgia and at @gthinduyuva. 
- @roshini.damodaran was the Mukhyashikshika for the Varg. 
- YUVA from @gthinduyuva
@hinduyuvagsu, @hinduyuvauga and HinduYUVA-UAB attend the event.
