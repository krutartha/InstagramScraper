GT Hindu YUVA and Vivekananda House are joining hands to help give back to the less fortunate this festive season, and WE WANT YOU TO JOIN US TOO!

How can you help:
- (If you're on campus) Bring fresh fruit and veggies, canned goods, or other non-perishable donations to the dropbox at the Vivekananda House (1069B McMillan St NW Atlanta GA, 30318). We will be collecting donations till December 10th, after which we will deliver them to Klemis Kitchen at Georgia Tech.

- Venmo Donations to @gtsewa

- Spread the word by sharing our post on social media and with your friends and family -- we'll be pushing out the Sewa Diwali Bingo board soon, so be sure to play along on your Instagram stories!!
