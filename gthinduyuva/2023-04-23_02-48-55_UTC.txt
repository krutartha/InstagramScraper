Happy Earth Day! 🌍 Today, Hindu YUVA volunteered with Students Organizing for Sustainability at Georgia Tech’s community garden. In efforts to be environmentally friendly, our future events will continue to use compostable plates, bowls, utensils, and napkins. Let us know if you have any other suggestions on how we can help the planet!
