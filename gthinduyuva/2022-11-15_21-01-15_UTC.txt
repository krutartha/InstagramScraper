As we approach Thanksgiving, Hindu YUVA is holding a Sewa Diwali initiative to fundraise and donate winter clothes & canned food for Food4Lives. Donations can be made until Nov 22, and please dm us if you have a donation that you would like to be picked up from you! All donations, no matter how small, make a difference! 🙏🏽🧣
