Thank you so much @gatechpd for giving us an opportunity to celebrate Universal Oneness Day with you at the department. Your openness and enthusiasm to celebrate Hindu traditions makes us feel included and accepted in the community. 

This celebration stems from the Hindu festival of Rakshabandan which is a celebration of our protectors. Tying Rakhi, the thread of protection, to our own campus police is a true honor as they make us feel safe and secure during our life at @georgiatech.
