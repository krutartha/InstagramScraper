Hi everyone!

Our next event is going to be on March 3rd to celebrate Maha Shivaratri!

We will be making shiva lingas from clay, sharing kathas relating to Shiva ji, and chanting bhajans. 

The meeting will be in Dawson Hall room 110 at 7:00 pm.

If you would like to share any bhajans or kathas during the meeting please let us know!
