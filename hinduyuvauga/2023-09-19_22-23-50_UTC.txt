Hi everyone! We are just over a week away from our next event, which is being held to celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi! We will have snacks, a murti-making competition, and aarti to honor Lord Ganesha. 

The event will be held next Thursday at the Tate Reception Hall (room 135) between 6:30-7:30 PM. Looking forward to seeing y'all there!
