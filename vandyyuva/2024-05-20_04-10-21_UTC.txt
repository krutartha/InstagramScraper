As summer dawns upon us, let’s take a glimpse at how the beginning of the Hindu new year was celebrated at Vanderbilt University. ✨ 

The HY Ugadi event on April 8, 2024 was a big success, thanks to all the lovely people who showed up and took part in Pooja and discussion, Prasadam and games, and Henna and so much more. 

Special thanks to @uabhinduyuva for all your help, we are so glad you came. ✨
